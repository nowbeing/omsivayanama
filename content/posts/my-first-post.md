Sundaranathar from south of India goes to Kailash to get initiated by Shiva. He then travels back to south to meet Agasthiya. He stays near Cauvery river where he witnesses a group of cows weeping for their cowherd, Moolan who is dead. Overcome by compassion, Sundaranathar transmigrates his soul to Moolan's body. After safely taking back the cows to the village, he comes back to find his own body missing. And so from then, he was called Thirumoolar, who later writes 3000 verses in a span of 3000 years, a book called Thirumandiram.

In the verse number 885, he talks about mystic syllables:

ஓர் எழுத்தாலே உலகு எங்கும் தானாகி  
ஈர் எழுத்தாலே இசைந்து அங்கு இருவராய்  
மூவெழுத்தாலே முளைக்கின்ற சோதியை  
மா எழுத்தாலே மயக்கமே உற்றதே  

அ : A   
அ, உ :  A, U   
அ, உ, ம் : A, U and M   
ம் : M   

By one syllable "A" he becomes all  
By two syllables "A" and "U" he becomes Siva and Sakthi  
By three "A", "U", and "M" syllables he becomes light of all  
By "M" Maya is manifested to create swoon (delusion)
